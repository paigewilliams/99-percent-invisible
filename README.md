## Description

This is a an exercise in re-building a site using Angular. This is an attempt to replicate the beautiful [99% invisible site](https://99percentinvisible.org/). I chose this site because I love the design, and I felt that the complexity of it would be a good challenge. The small details like audio footer that follows as you scroll through the page and the tasteful hover effects create simple intrigue to the site.

THIS IS A REPLICA AND IS NOT THE REAL SITE! THIS WAS CREATED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES!

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.

## Planning

  1. Draw a diagram of the site

  2. Draw the flow of the components

  3. Begin building components

  4. Create Layout of page with components

  5. Build out individual components


### Desired Features

- [ ] Deployed to Firebase
- [ ] Database with podcasts and articles
- [ ] Pipes to filter podcasts and articles -- functional search bar and links to filer by category
- [ ] Embedded audio
- [ ] Replicate playlist footer
- [ ] Implement [Listen Notes API](https://www.listennotes.com/api/)
- [ ] Create animation with logo



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
