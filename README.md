## Description

This is a an exercise in re-building a site using Angular. This is an attempt to replicate the beautiful [99% invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/) site. I chose this site because I love the design, and I felt that the complexity of it would be a good challenge. The small details like audio footer that follows as you scroll through the page and the tasteful hover effects create simple intrigue to the site.

THIS IS A REPLICA AND IS NOT THE REAL SITE! THIS WAS CREATED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES!

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.

## Planning

  1. Draw a diagram of the site

  2. Draw the flow of the components

  3. Begin building components

  4. Create Layout of page with components

  5. Build out individual components
  
  6. Style individual components
  
  #### To do next Friday:
  
  7. Connect to a database
  
  8. Populate database with podcast and article data
  
  9. Create pipes to filter by category -- episode cards will be updated based on filter
  


### Desired Features

- [ ] Deployed to Firebase
- [ ] Database with podcasts and articles
- [ ] Pipes to filter podcasts and articles -- functional search bar and links to filter by category
- [ ] Embedded audio
- [ ] Replicate playlist footer
- [ ] Implement [Listen Notes API](https://www.listennotes.com/api/)

## Objectives

- [ ] Project includes a **detailed** README with information on all completed features as well as features to be added.
- [ ] Project includes a **detailed** commit history that clearly shows at least eight hours of work between 8 and 5 on Friday. You are also welcome to put additional work into your project outside of that time frame.
- [ ] Project demonstrates understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
